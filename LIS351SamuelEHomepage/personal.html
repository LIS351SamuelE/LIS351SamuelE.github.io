	<h1>Sam's Personal Life</h1>

	<h2>Background</h2>

		<p>I was born in Columbus, WI, which happens to be about 30 miles outside of Madison. At the age of 6, I moved to Oconomowoc, WI, where I currently live to this day when I am not on campus in Madison. I have 2 brothers; Duffy and Jacob. Duffy, the oldest brother, went to school here in Madison. He is currently in Graduate School at the University of Florida. Jacob, the youngest brother, goes to school at MSOE in Milwaukee. Both my brothers are shorter than me; which I like to brag about.</p>
