	<h1>Interests and Hobbies</h1>

	<h2>Sports</h2>

		<p>Like I said on my homepage, I am interested in Wisconsin Badgers Athletics, Milwaukee Brewers, Green Bay Packers, and Milwaukee Bucks. I have been to so many games from each of these teams that I can not put a number to it. From these sports, I would have to say watching Badgers Football is my favorite. The atmosphere and gamely experience is simply unmatched.</p>

	<h2>Outdoors</h2>

		<p>In the summer, I like to go on long walks in state parks. My favorite place to walk is Lapham Peak in Kettle Moraine. When it is hot, I like to go on our boat in Upper Wisconsin and enjoy the weather. I would definitely say my favorite season is the summer because of the warm weather. Wisconsin is simply too cruel in the winter.</p>
